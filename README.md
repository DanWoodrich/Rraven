# Rraven

A tool to exchange data between R and [Raven bioacoustic software](http://www.birds.cornell.edu/brp/raven/RavenOverview.html). Functions work on data formats compatible with the R package [warbleR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/warbleR/). Sound files can be send to Raven from R to conduct acoustic measures and the resulting data retrieved to R for further analysis.
